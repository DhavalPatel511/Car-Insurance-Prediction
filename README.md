# Car Insurance Prediction Project

## Overview:

The Car Insurance Prediction project focuses on predicting whether a customer has car insurance or not. The project involves reading a CSV file in Python using the Pandas library, followed by data exploration, visualization, cleaning, and feature engineering using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. After data processing, a Ridge Classifier model is created to predict the target variable, which is car insurance. The project identifies the top 5 features that most impact the prediction of car insurance.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Reading and Exploration:**
   - Read the CSV file containing the dataset using Pandas.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and data types.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualize the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure data quality.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
   - Utilize techniques such as one-hot encoding, binning, or scaling to prepare the features for modeling.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Implement a Ridge Classifier model to predict whether a customer has car insurance.
   - Train the model on the processed dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

6. **Feature Importance Analysis:**
   - Identify the top 5 features that have the most significant impact on predicting car insurance.
   - Analyze how these features contribute to the model's predictions.

## Usage:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhavalPatel511/Car-Insurance-Prediction.git
   cd car-insurance-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided in the repository.
   - Execute the code cells to perform data exploration, visualization, cleaning, feature engineering, and model building.

## Results:

The Car Insurance Prediction project delivers insights into customer behavior and factors influencing car insurance purchases. By leveraging machine learning techniques and feature importance analysis, the project identifies the key drivers of car insurance decisions and provides a predictive model for future use.
